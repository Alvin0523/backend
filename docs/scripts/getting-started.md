# Getting started

This getting started guide will run through 

1. how to install the required requirements
2. how to start the app

<hr>

\* note: all commands are meant to be executed from the root directory of the app.

## Install requirements

This is to install all required requirements for the app

=== "MacOS/ Linux"
    ``` bash
    sh scripts/install-requirements.sh
    ```
    
=== "Windows"
    ``` bash
    todo
    ```


## Spin up the services

This is to run the app

=== "MacOS/ Linux"
    ``` bash
    sh scripts/start.sh
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ``` bash
    todo
    ```

The console should now show you where to find the website. If all is done right, [this page](http://127.0.0.1:8000) should load correctly.

## Live documentation

When app is running locally, use the following (depending on preferences) for live documentation

- [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

- [Re-docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
